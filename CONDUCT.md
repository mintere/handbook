Hey there!

Mintere is building the best marketing company on Earth - and you're now part of the team making that happen. Of course, to be the best marketing company on Earth, we have to create a welcoming and supportive environment for everyone. To that end, this is our Code of Conduct.

Mintere's community includes people from many different backgrounds. Mintere is committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age, disability, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, nationality, neurotype, personal appearance, political affiliation, professional background, race, religion, or sexual identity or orientation.

## TL;DR:

- Treat everyone with respect and kindness.
- Be thoughtful in how you communicate.
- Don't be destructive, discriminatory, harassing, or inflammatory.
- If you encounter an issue, please report it using [this form][report-form].

## Scope

Our Code of Conduct applies whenever you're interacting with Mintere or Mintere team members, representing Mintere,
or otherwise participating in our community.

Enforcement of the Code of Conduct applies to:
- All Mintere open source projects
- All Mintere hosted events and video calls
- All Mintere client meetings and communications between clients and Mintere team members
- The Mintere Basecamp account
- All Mintere-owned social media accounts, or other public social media activity of Mintere employees
    - As a digital marketing company, our employee's social media activity may reflect on Mintere.
      While we expect people to understand that your views don't necessarily represent Mintere's views,
      any public misconduct could damage both the reputation of Mintere and our clients.

**Team members:** Please remember that even your behavior outside of times when you're directly representing
Mintere often reflects on our company and community. As an employee or member of Mintere, any action in
violation of this Code that could reflect poorly on Mintere may be treated as a violation, regardless of where it occurs.

## Values

These are the values to which people in our community should aspire. 

Remember: These are not hard and fast rules, and we don't expect you to be perfect all the time. If you're acting in
good faith and accidentally break one of these, we won't find you in violation of the Code of Conduct, except in severe cases,
such as if your behavior is part of a pattern or creates a hostile environment.

- Be friendly and welcoming
- Be patient
- Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language
  (meaning and tone can be lost in translation).
- Be thoughtful
- Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.
- Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.
- Be respectful
  - In particular, respect differences of opinion.
  - Be charitable
  - Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.
  - When we do disagree, try to understand why.
- Avoid destructive behavior:
  - Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.
  - Unconstructive criticism: don't merely condemn the current state of affairs; offer—or at least
     solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved.
  - Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)
  - Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.
  - Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral, and environmental indignities that communicate
    hostile, derogatory, or negative slights and insults to a person or group.

People are complicated. You should expect to be misunderstood and to misunderstand others; when this inevitably occurs, resist the urge to be defensive or assign blame. Try not to take offense where no offense was intended. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Even if the intent was to provoke, do not rise to it. Your goal should be to de-escalate conflict when it arises.

## Unwelcome behavior

These actions are explicitly forbidden, and are grounds for immediate termination or expulsion from the community:

- insulting, demeaning, hateful, or threatening remarks;
- discrimination based on age, disability, ethnicity, gender identity or expression,
  nationality, neurotype, personal appearance, political affiliation, professional background,
  race, religion, or sexual identity or orientation, any protected class, or similar personal characteristic;
- bullying or systematic harassment; and
- unwelcome sexual advances, including sexually explicit content.

## Moderation & Enforcement

Please understand that speech and actions have consequences, and unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated.
If you conduct yourself in a way that is forbidden by the Code of Conduct, you will be warned and asked to stop.

This procedure only serves as a general guideline for moderation & enforcement of our community conduct.
Under all circumstances, Mintere's staff members may take any action we deem appropriate, including immediate removal
from the community. Being banned from the Mintere community may also prevent you from participating in our community
events, activities, or future employment.

Please understand that we will not restrict your ability to contact Mintere under any circumstance.
If you have any questions or concerns about our decision, please reach out to us directly.

### Employees:

Any violation of this Code of Conduct is grounds for us requiring temporary unpaid leave.
Repeated or severe offenses will be grounds for immediate termination of your employment.

### Clients: 

Your Master Services Agreement requires you and your staff to comply with this Code of Conduct. Please review
the Acceptable Conduct clause in the Agreement for details.

## Reporting Violations

If you encounter a conduct-related issue, you should report it to Mintere using the process described below.
Please do not try to publicly rally sentiment against a particular individual or group.

Report using our [conduct report form][report-form] or, for employees, by getting in touch with your manager.

Note that managers are required to enforce this Code of Conduct on their team. Managers must inform the Conduct
Working group of all reported violations. Failure to do so is a violation of the Code of Conduct.

All Mintere team members are required to report all violations or suspected violations of the Code of Conduct.
For team members (only), failing to report a violation of the Code of Conduct will be treated as a seperate violation.

Please know that you will be protected from any sort of retailiation for filing a conduct report in good faith.
Relatiating against someone for reporting a conduct violation will be treated as a seperate, severe violation of this
Code of Conduct.

You should err on the side of reporting, even if you don't have evidence of a violation. Even suspected violations
can help us understand and investigate patterns of behavior that violate this code of conduct.

Mintere will strive to handle reports with discretion and sensitivity, to protect the privacy of the involved parties,
and to avoid conflicts of interest. We will use our best efforts to keep this report confidential, but please remember
that we may be obligated to disclose certain information by law, or when it's in the best interest of our community or
company. You are, however, allowed to report a violation anonymously.

Mintere may reach out to other community members for more context.

When possible, we will reach out to the original reporter to let them know the decision of our Conduct Working Group.
Please note this may not be possible in all circumstances.

Our goal is to respond to reports within 48 hours.

The Working Group will reach a decision as to how to act. These may include:
  - Nothing.
  - A private or public warning.
  - An imposed vacation (for instance, asking someone to abstain for a week from the Basecamp or a GitHub project).
  - A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Mintere spaces.
  - For employees, immediate termination or temporary unpaid leave.
  - For clients, we may find you in breach of our agreement.

Appeals to the decision may be made to the Working Group, or to any of its members directly.

Note that the goal of the Code of Conduct and the Working Group is to resolve conflicts in the most harmonious way possible.
We hope that in most cases issues may be resolved through polite discussion. Bannings and other forceful measures are considered
last resorts - but we may impose any reasonable consequence for violations of the Code of Conduct.

## Improving this Code of Conduct

Remember: our goal is to protect the Mintere community and create a welcoming place to work. This is a working document, and we'd love
your feedback and improvements, no matter how long you've been a part of our community or how you participate.

Changes to the Code of Conduct should be proposed by creating an issue or making a pull request to this document.
